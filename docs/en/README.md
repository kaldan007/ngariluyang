<h1>Ngari Luyang</h1>
Ngari, often referred to as the ocean of songs, is home to a rich musical heritage. In order to preserve and propagate this tradition, the "Ngari Luyang" initiative has been established, focusing on the authentic rendition of various genres of Ngari songs.

Efforts are being made to revitalize the dying genres of Ngari music, including Tseglu, Shunglu, and many others. As this initiative is open to collaboration, we kindly invite you to contribute. Contributions can take many forms, such as recording Ngari songs from local artists and forwarding the recordings to us, or transcribing lyrics and emailing them.

We welcome anyone who wishes to utilize our materials, and while not required, a small acknowledgment would be appreciated to aid in raising awareness of this cultural preservation effort.
