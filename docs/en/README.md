# Monlam AI

Monlam AI is a project of Monlam IT. It is an effort to develop Tibetan language technology in order to bridge the technology and language divides in the Tibetan communities. Over the next three years, this project will improve Tibetan AI in three major areas:

Machine Translation
OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
Speech-to-Text + Text-to-Speech
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models “learn” from large amounts of high-quality training data prepared by humans. This project will focus on creating this training data for Tibetan language.

This project is maintained by MonlamAI
